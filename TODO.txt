1. Get stimulus set [OK]
 
   We start from VGG16 with dataset objects/animals which have a 1100*1080 dimension

2. Get firing rate responses set [CORRECTION SPIKE-SORTING]

3. Download pretrained models (VGG, ResNet) [OK]

4. -Reformat stimuli to fit input layer [OK for objects but we have to discuss for other stimuli]

    The original format is 649*405, aspect ratio : 0.624
    The format for imagenet is 224*224. I wonder if in 
    the paper by Guclu there is a discussion of this problem.
     
5. -Parallelization features computation with joblib [DONE]
    ISSUE : hard lock joblib - keras

6. -Theano - Keras mixing

    import theano
    get_activations = theano.function([model.layers[0].input],
    model.layers[1].output(train=False), allow_input_downcast=True)
    activations = get_activations(X_batch) # same result as above

7. -Parallelization GPU and MPI [DONE]

8. Sparse linear model fit from feature representation (at all layers)
   to responses 

9. Decoding latent variables

10. Retrain last layer and repeat
