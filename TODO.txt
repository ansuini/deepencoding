1. Stimuli set
2. Firing rate responses set
3. Pretrained model (VGG)
4. Reformat stimuli to fit input layer
5. Sparse linear model fit from feature representation
to responses
6. Verify property of generalization
7. Decoding of latent variables
8. Retrain last layer and repeat



First compute features for all images. This is 
done in parallel for it takes 41 s for each image
ResNet on my laptop

Then train the sparselin to encode with
crossvalidation, estimate error on test set

Do decoding of latent variables

Retrain last layer to refine and compare decoding
performances with the first original case
